### **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Scope Definition**  
*(Audience: Product Owners/Business Stakeholders)*  

1. **Elicit Functional Requirements**  
   - Identify core entities: `Student`, `Teacher`, `Administrator`, `Discipline`, `Grade`, `Subscription`.  
   - Define actions:  
     - Teachers: Create disciplines, submit grades.  
     - Students: Subscribe to disciplines, view grades/status.  
     - Admin: Resolve inconsistencies (e.g., grade conflicts).  
   - Authentication: All actions require login (RBAC: Roles = Student/Teacher/Admin).  

2. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**  
   - Security: Data encryption, audit logs.  
   - Performance: Support 10k concurrent users during grade submission.  
   - Compliance: FERPA/GDPR (if applicable).  

3. **Prioritize with Stakeholders**  
   - Use MoSCoW (Must-have: Auth/Grades, Should-have: Notifications).  

---

### **Phase 2: High-Level Architecture (HLA)**  
*(Audience: Product Owners + Developers)*  

1. **Define Architectural Style**  
   - Layered (Presentation → Business Logic → Data) + Microservices (if scalability is critical).  

2. **Component Diagram**  
   - **Frontend**: Web app (React/Angular) + Mobile (optional).  
   - **Backend**:  
     - Auth Service (OAuth2/JWT).  
     - Discipline Service (CRUD).  
     - Grade Service (Submit/Calculate Status).  
     - Subscription Service (Enrollment).  
   - **Database**:  
     - Relational (SQL) for transactional data (Grades/Subscriptions).  
     - Document (NoSQL) for unstructured data (e.g., discipline descriptions).  

3. **External Integrations**  
   - SSO (e.g., Active Directory).  
   - Email/SMS for notifications.  

4. **Deployment View**  
   - Cloud (AWS/Azure) with containers (Docker/K8s) for scalability.  

---

### **Phase 3: Mid-Level Design**  
*(Audience: Developers + Testers)*  

1. **API Contracts**  
   - REST/GraphQL endpoints:  
     - `POST /grades {studentId, disciplineId, value}`.  
     - `GET /students/{id}/status` (returns "Approved/Reproved").  

2. **Data Flow architecture.*  
   - How grades propagate: Teacher → Grade Service → Database → Student Dashboard.  

3. **Database Schema**  
   - Tables: `Students (id, name, email)`, `Disciplines (id, name, teacher_id)`, `Grades (id, student_id, discipline_id, value)`.  

4. **State Transitions**  
   - Student status changes from "Pending" → "Approved" when grades ≥ passing score.  

5. **Security Design**  
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) matrix:  
     - Teachers: `write:grades`, `read:disciplines`.  
     - Students: `read:grades`, `write:subscriptions`.  

---

### **Phase 4: Low-Level Design (LLD)**  
*(Audience: Developers)*  

1. **Class architecture.*  
   - `Student` class: `calculateStatus()` method (business rule for approval).  

2. **Algorithmic Logic**  
   - How "Approved/Reproved" is calculated (e.g., weighted average ≥ 7.0).  

3. **Error Handling**  
   - Retry logic for grade submission failures.  
   - Idempotency keys for duplicate requests.  

4. **Testability Hooks**  
   - Mock interfaces for Grade Service (test edge cases like null grades).  

---

### **Phase 5: Cross-Cutting Concerns**  
*(Audience: All)*  

1. **Logging**  
   - Structured logs (e.g., JSON) for auditing grade changes.  

2. **Monitoring**  
   - Dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana) for failed logins, grade submissions.  

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
   - Blue-green deployments to avoid downtime during updates.  

---

### **Phase 6: Validation & Feedback**  
*(Audience: Product Owners + Testers)*  

1. **Architecture Review**  
   - Walkthrough with developers (validate feasibility).  
   - Threat modeling (e.g., student impersonation attacks).  

2. **Prototyping**  
   - Spike: Implement auth flow + grade submission to test performance.  

3. **Documentation**  
   - HLA: C4 Model (Context, Containers, Components).  
   - LLD: Swagger for APIs, ER architecture.for DB.  

---

### **Deliverables per Audience**  
- **Product Owners**: HLA architecture. feature priorities.  
- **Developers**: API specs, database schema, class architecture.  
- **Testers**: Data flow architecture. edge cases (e.g., grade > 100).  

This process ensures clarity at each level while allowing flexibility for design patterns to emerge from constraints.
